Applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to identify basic information real-time on road:
- Capturing vehicle information: color, type, license plate thus extract meta data of the vehicle as owner, driving history, in-frame time and out-frame time ect.
- Capturinng vehicle speed and tracking vehicle position within its lane thus identify the legal consideration of vehicle, automatically output list of illegal individual with 
    various common traffic rules
